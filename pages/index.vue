      engineering. I am currently a software engineer at

      I received my Master's in Computer Science from the University of Texas at
      Austin, where I spent a few years researching privacy. I grew up in
      Missoula, Montana, and attended college at Gonzaga University, where I
      majored in computer science, math, and art. I moved to Tokyo in early 2018
      with no job, just an eager dream of living abroad. In my spare time, I
      enjoy Japanese Calligraphy 書道, Nihonga painting　日本画, and riding slow
      trains around Japan.
