          I received my Master's in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin,
          where I spent a few years researching privacy. I grew up in Missoula, Montana, and
          attended college at Gonzaga University, where I majored in computer science, math,
          and art. I moved to Tokyo in early 2018 with no job, just an eager dream of living abroad.
          In my spare time, I enjoy Japanese Calligraphy (Shodo), Nihonga painting, and
          riding slow trains around Japan.
